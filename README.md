## Abstract
This application is a travel agency service platform. A viewer can sign in as a user or agent.

The travel user has the capabilities to view all their trips, past, present, future, pending; along with the details for each trip. They can also request a new booking.

An agent can view all user trips. Their landing page display the company's calendar-year revenue, trip requests, and trips active today. Using the search bar an agent can look up any user and view their entire trip log. The agent can approve or deny pending trips or delete upcoming trips.

## Learning Goals
- Reinforce React fundamentals
- Reinforce using React Router to create a multi-page user experience
- Reinforce component and asynchronous JS testing
- Work with and navigate a shared, persistent API using GET, POST, and DELETE requests
